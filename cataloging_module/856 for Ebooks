Adding 856 field to existing bibliographic record

This document is not intended to explain cataloging of electronic resources, but only give guidance on providing access to an electronic version of an existing item by enhancing the bibliographic record.  For the sake of brevity I will only discuss http resources (856 4_) see appropriate documentation for other access methods (identified by IND 1 of 856 tag). Spacing is for readability; do not use spaces when actually entering a URL via the 856 tag.

For additional information see:

In addition to adding the appropriate 856, 530, and 538 tags, you may want to look at identifying information in the item record for future use in creating reports. 

Notes are not necessary for table of contents, publisher descriptions and related websites such as the author's homepage.

BMCC has an itype and location for Internet resources.  This allows us to identify web-based holdings such as subscription databases and online Government Documents.

At this time I am using a call number of "Available online" or "Available online – BMCC only"
Example titles you may want to look at are:

Gaming [electronic resource] : selected resources from UNLV
Vital statistics of the United States [electronic resource 
Contemporary authors [electronic resource]
