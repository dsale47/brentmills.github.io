Cataloging an “Advanced reader copy” or “Uncorrected proof”



Advanced reader copies, uncorrected proofs, and galley proofs are generally copies released prior to publication for editing and/or reviewing proposes.  If your library should choose to add these to your collection and thus to the Sage System you need be sure to notate the record appropriately so that the bib is not used for a regular copy since sometimes pagination, dimensions, or publication information will vary.  To do this you need to invalidate the 010 and/or 020 (using subfield |z) and use the edition/history note field (500) to identify it as such.  [Don’t place the information in the 250 field, as the information is not really an edition statement.]

Examples: 	010 __ |z9999000000
		020 __ |z9781111111111
		500 __ “Advanced reader copy”–Cover.
		500 __ “Uncorrected proof”–Cover.
